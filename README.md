# Super c

## Learning Goals

- Recognize how to use the `super` method
- Recognize how to use the `super` object

## Introduction

In addition to simply extending classes, JavaScript provides an additional
keyword, `super`, for directly working with a parent class constructor and
inherited methods.

## Recognize How to Use the `super` Method

In the code below, we have two JavaScript classes: `Pet` and `Dog`. The `Dog`
class is a _child_ class of `Pet` and it uses the `extends` keyword to inherit
methods from the parent class:

```js
class Pet {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
    this.owner = null;
  }

  speak() {
    return `${this.name} speaks.`;
  }
}

// Inherits from Pet
class Dog extends Pet {
  constructor(name, breed) {
    super(name); /* new */
    this.breed = breed;
  }
}

const creature = new Pet("The Thing");
const dog = new Dog("Spot", "Foxhound");

dog;
// => Dog { name: 'Spot', owner: null, breed: 'Foxhound' }
```

Above, there is something new. The `Pet` class takes in a `name` parameter,
assigns it to the `name` property, and _also_ creates an `owner` property,
setting it to `null`. The `Dog` class takes in `name` and `breed` properties,
calls `super`, passing in the name, then sets `this.breed` to the provided
breed.

What is happening? In our `Dog` constructor, we are able to use `super` to call
the `Pet` constructor. Doing this will set up the `name` and `owner`
properties. Then, once complete, the `Dog` constructor continues to execute,
setting `breed`.

In a child class constructor, `super` is used as a **method** and calls the
parent class constructor before continuing with the child. This lets us extend a
parent's constructor inside a child. If we need to define custom behavior in a
child constructor, we can do so without having to override or ignore the parent.

## Recognize How to Use the `super` Object

Outside of the constructor, the `super` keyword is also used, but this time, as
an `object`. When used, it refers to parent class' properties or methods.

We could, for instance, use `super.speak()` from the `info` method in our `Dog`
class to call the `speak` method in the parent `Pet` class:

```js
// Inherits from Pet
class Dog extends Pet {
  constructor(name, breed) {
    super(name); /* new */
    this.breed = breed;
  }

  get info() {
    return `${this.name} is a ${this.breed}. ${super.speak()}`;
  }
}

const charlie = new Dog("Charlie B. Barkin", "Mutt");

charlie.info;
// => 'Charlie B. Barkin is a Mutt. Charlie B. Barkin speaks.'

const lady = new Dog("Lady", "Cocker Spaniel");

lady.info;
// => 'Lady is a Cocker Spaniel. Lady speaks.'
```

In the above code, we've added an `info` getter that uses `super.speak()` to
call the `speak` method in the parent class.

**However**, since instance methods and properties are _already_ inherited, this
_will be the same as using_ `this.speak()`.

Using `super` as an object is useful in situations where a parent class contains
a static method that we want to expand on in a child class:

```js
class Pet {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
    this.owner = null;
  }

  static definition() {
    return `A pet is an animal kept primarily for a person's company.`;
  }
}

// Inherits from Pet
class Dog extends Pet {
  constructor(name, breed) {
    super(name);
    this.breed = breed;
  }

  static definition() {
    return (
      super.definition() + " Dogs are one of the most common types of pets."
    );
  }
}

const creature = new Pet("The Thing");
const dog = new Dog("Spot", "foxhound");

Pet.definition();
// => "A pet is an animal kept primarily for a person's company."
Dog.definition();
// => "A pet is an animal kept primarily for a person's company. Dogs are one of the most common types of pets."
```

In the `Pet` class above, we've included a static method, `definition()`, for
what a pet is. In `Dog`, we are able to use `super.definition()` to access that
static method, then _add_ to it, in this case, extending the definition to
specifically reference dogs.

## Conclusion

In this lesson, we dove deeper into class extensions and inheritance in
JavaScript. In combination with `extends`, `super` allows a child class to
access a parent's constructor from within a child's constructor. It also allows
a child class to access methods and properties from a parent class, but as most
of these are already inherited, this is only useful when modifying static
methods from the parent class.
